				API stands for "Application Programming Interface". Let's say you are building a website and you want to include data from 
				another website (The New York Times) into your own website. The New York Times website is a program that runs on its own 
				server and your website is a program that runs on your own server (this could just be your laptop or some outside server that
				you upload your project to). Ultimately, the two servers need to be able to "talk" to each other so that data can be exchanged 
				from the New York Times to your own website. The two servers need an interface by which they can talk to each other. 
				This is what an API is. To put it simply, an API is an interface which allows for computers to talk to each other.

				The number of different types of API's out there is endless. A good example of an API is social media plug-ins that you may see 
				on certain websites. This may be a news article that embeds tweets from Twitter or it could be a web page that lets people leave 
				Facebook comments under it. In this example of social media, both Twitter and Facebook have their own API's that they make 
				available for people who build their own websites. This makes it easy for these people to integrate Twitter and Facebook features 
				into their own websites. Check out the list below to get an idea of some other API's that are out there. You can click on each 
				list item to go directly to that API website.

				Now that you have a basic idea of what an API is, it is time to look at one API in detail - the New York Times API. Click 
				on the button below to take the next step and to get a closer look at this API.
