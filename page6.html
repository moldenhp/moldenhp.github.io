				Up to this point in the tutorial we have pretty much looked at just one example of how the New York Times API could be used. 
				We let someone visiting our web page to enter in a search word and then we used JavaScript to take that search word and make a 
				request. Once that request was returned back to us we then accessed the data that was returned and we displayed it on the screen. 
				Lets now expand our knowledge about the New York Times API and see what other options it offers.<br><br>
				Earlier in this tutorial I pointed it out that the New York Times API allows for multiple search parameters when you make a 
				request. This means that in addition to the search word "computer", you can also restrict your search in other ways such as articles with 
				a specific source, a specific publication date or a specific word count. These are just a few of the many different ways that you 
				can filter and restrict your search results. You can have as many different search parameters as you want to filter the search 
				results and get back only the articles the pertain most to the search criteria. In the code portion below, there are a few different 
				examples of making requests with multiple parameters. To save space, I only included the "req.open" line of code for each 
				example because the rest of the code will remain pretty much the same. Just remember that in these examples we are using 
				multiple parameters so you will be adding multiple values to the root API URL. You should have a way to initialze these 
				different values such as by letting the user of your website enter in multiple text boxes in a form. I have added in 
				comments above each line that briefly describes what each line accomplishes.
			</p><br>
			
			<pre>
// This line will search for articles with a specific search word and also restrict the search to a specific source
req.open("GET","https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q="+ searchWord + "&fq=source:" + theSource + "&api-key=" + apikey, true);


// This line will search for articles that are restricted to the specific search word and that are published within the begin and end dates
req.open("GET","https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q="+ searchWord + "&begin_date=" + beginDate + "&end_date=" + endDate + "&api-key=" + apikey, true); 


// This line will restrict searches base on search word, returns results 20 - 29 and the results are also sorted by oldest to newest
req.open("GET","https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q="+ searchWord + "&page=2&sort=oldest" + "&api-key=" + apikey, true);
			</pre><br>
			
			<p>
				You should note that in the third example of the code above, I stated that the request "returns results 20 - 29". If you 
				have not already realized, each time you make a request for multiple articles, the New York Times API returns an array of article objects 
				that are typically about 10 objects long. The New York Times API has a limit on how much data is returned with each call. 
				You can therefore access more article data (beyond the initial 10) if you make another call with a parameter for page 2 or 
				page 3 etc. If you look closely in the example above you can see where "&page=2" is embedded in the URL. As a result this 
				will return the article data beyond the intial array of data that the "page 1" would return.<br><br> 
				Remember all of the other different "sub-categories" of the New York Times API besides just the article search? You can 
				look back at "The New York Times API" page of this tutorial to refresh your memory. Lets now take a look at a full code 
				segment that requests data from another category from the API - specifically the "top stories" category. This code 
				segment is similar to the previous example where the user enters in the word "computer" and the API returns articles that 
				contain that search word. Only now with the "top stories" category there will be a search "category" that the user enters 
				and the API will  
				return an array of the top stories about that category instead of just an assortment of articles that contain 
				a specific search word. In the following code segment we are making a request for all of the top stories under the 
				category of "science". We then access the returned data and display the titles of each article to the screen.
			</p><br>
			
			<pre>
	document.getElementById("loc").addEventListener('click', function (event){
	var req= new XMLHttpRequest();
	var category = "science";
	req.open("GET","https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/" + category + ".json?" + "api-key=" + apikey, true);
	req.addEventListener("load", function(){
		if(req.status >=200 && req.status < 400){
			var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
			console.log(response);
			
			function gotData(response){
				var articles = response.results;
				
				for (var i = 0; i < articles.length; i++){
					console.log(articles[i].title);
					var theTitle = document.createElement("h1");  
					var titleText = document.createTextNode(articles[i].title);
					theTitle.appendChild(titleText);
					document.body.appendChild(theTitle);
				}
			}
			gotData(response);
		}
		else
			console.log("Error " + req.statusText);
	})
					
	req.send(null);
	event.preventDefault();
})
			</pre><br>
			
			<p>
				Go ahead and try for yourself some other categories of the New York Times API such as movie reviews and the "most popular" category. 
				There is a lot that you can do with this API. I have only scratched the surface with the few examples that I have given. 
				However, from what we have gone over in this tutorial should give you enough of an understanding to explore and code more 
				complicated requests to the New York Times API. I will end this tutorial by leaving you with some challenges to accomplish 
				with the this API. If you get stuck, look back at similar calls to the API and read up in the "README" sections of the 
				New York Times API website. Goodluck and happy coding!<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Display on the screen the headlines of all of the articles that contain the word "JavaScript" in them.</li>
					<li>Let the user of your web page select a year and then get a list of articles from that particular year.</li>
					<li>Make a request to the New York Times API to look at trends for the frequency a word appears in articles for a 
						given year. For example, make a request to the API that allows you to determine when the word "computer" 
						started to get used ofent in articles.</li>
					<li>Let the user of your web page select a year and then make a request to determine how many times the word "war" is 
						used in the articles vs. the word "peace".</li>
					<li>Make a request to the API and then sort the results alphabetically.</li>
				</ul><br>
