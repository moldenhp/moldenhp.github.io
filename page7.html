				API's are a huge part of the web. In 2013 there were over 10,000 API's published by companies for open 
				consumption (<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/programmablewebs-directory-hits-10000-apis.-and-counting./analysis/2013/09/23">source</a>). 					
				I can only imagine how much that number has grown since then. With so many companies investing in this new area of 
				business, possessing a working understading of API's is crucial to careers in the software industry. I hope that through this 
				tutorial you have gained even a basic understanding of what API's are and how they can be used. <br><br>
				I chose to build this tutorial around the New York Times API specifically because I have a strong interest in current events 
				and local/world news. If you wish to learn more about API's, I recommend that you pick a topic that you are interested in. See 
				if there is an API that relates to your topic of choice and then start playing around with it. I think that you will be motivated to learn a lot more about API's 
				if you start with an API that you are interested in. There are so many API's out there. Explore and have fun with it!
