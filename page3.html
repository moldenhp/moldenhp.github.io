				The New York Times API is an API that you can use to request information about articles from the New York Times. Makes sense right? 
				Lets take a closer look at this API to understand how to navigate its documentation, how to form an API query, get data from 
				the API, look at the data and then make something happen on the screen in a web page (through the use of JavaScript, HTML and CSS). 
				To start, glance over the New York Times API webpage <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">HERE</a>. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To begin using the New York Times API you need to first request an API key. Wait, an API key? What is that? Basically, if a company 
				or an organization or a person is opening up their data, they want you to identify yourself when you are asking for the data. So you 
				have to sign up and get a special key which will identify you. This way the company (or in this case the New York Times) can track how often 
				you are accessing their data and what you are using their data for. Don't worry, it is free to request an API key and you only have 
				to supply an email address. Once you enter in your email information an API key will be emailed to you and now you can start using the 
				New York Times API. The image below is a small screen-shot of the New York Times API web-page and shows you what to click on to request 
				an API key.
			</p><br>
			<center><img src="key.png"></center><br>
			
			<p>
				Now that you have an API key, lets see what the New York Times API has to offer. If you scroll down on the New York Times API web-page, 
				you can see that there are a lot of different categories that are available to you. Some of these include article search, 
				most popular, movie reviews and top stories. These different categories are essentially "sub-API's" or different paths within the 
				larger New York Times API. For simplicity, this tutorial will focus on the article search but it is good to be aware of the fact 
				that there is more to this API than this one category. 
				An interesting fact is that the article search in the New York Times API actually goes back to the year 1851. So for example you can 
				search for all the articles in the New York Times that have the word "outrageous" in them since 1851. To use the article search, click 
				on the Article Search category on the New York Times API web-page (see image). 
			</p>
			
			<center><img src="article.png"></center><br>
			
			<p>
				Once you click on "Article Search" you will be given some documentation on how the article search works. On this page you 
				are given two options which both expand to give you more information: "show details" and "try it out". Neither one of these 
				options are extremely easy to understand for someone at a beginner level so I will attempt to make this as clear as possible for you. 
				Essentially what you want to do to search for articles is to use a JavaScript function in your web site to make a call to the 
				New York Times API URL (https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json). Along with this URL you will use additional parameters added on to the 
				URL that corresponds to whatever search criteria that you want to search for. If you click on the "show detials" button while 
				still on the Article Search page, you will be given information on all of the different kinds of parameters that you can add on 
				to the URL to make a successful search (see image below). Besides the basic search query word that you use, some other optional parameters include 
				begin date, end date and sort options. So using these additional parameters you could conduct a search and restrict by only getting 
				articles from the year 1945 that contain a particular word or you could sort the articles that you get back by a specific order. 
				For now, lets just stick to conducting an article search based on a specific search query word. 
			</p><br>
			
			<center><img src="parameters.png"></center><br>
			
			<p>
				This sounds confusing so let me give you an example. Lets say that you want to use the New York Times API to search for articles 
				that contain the word "computer" in them. You would then create a JavaScript function to make a call to the root URL plus the 
				word that is to be searched for. So the URL that you would make a call to would be:<br><br>
				<center>https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q [root URL] + computer [search word] = https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=computer </center><br>
				You are not done yet though. Remember how you had to get an API key? You now have to add on your API key to the end of this URL 
				to successfully make the call to the API. I will use my API key to show the final URL to use to make the call...<br><br>
				<center>https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=computer&api-key=b79606f1042e40b483c8690d72b21ca3</center><br>
				You can now use the above URL in your JavaScript code for your website to successfully make a call to the New York Times API 
				based on the search criteria (in this case it is "computer"). In fact you don't even need to use JavaScript to make this call. 
				You can simply copy the above URL and paste it into your web browser. Go ahead try it! 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you did in fact copy and paste the URL into your web browser you may have been surprised at the result. 
				Even though the text that appears on the screen looks like a mess of words, numbers and slashes, there is 
				in fact an order to the text all over the screen. Once you made the call 
				to the API by entering in the URL into the browser, the API returned this text that you see on the screen. This text that is 
				returned from the API is JSON data. <b>JSON</b> data (JavaScript Object Notation) is commonly used in data exchange over the 
				internet. Similar to working with objects in JavaScript, JSON data is a type of data that contains properties and methods. For 
				example, the data returned from the New York Times API may contain an "article object". That article object may contain a "headline" 
				property that contains text for the headline of the article and it may also contain a "snippit" property that contains a text snippit
				that describes the article. If you look closely at all of the text that is displayed on the screen you can see where some of the article 
				objects start and where their corresponding headlines and snippits start. You can then take all of this data that is returned from 
				the New York Times API and use it in your own website that you build. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Simply entering in a URL into a web browser and viewing the result on the screen is not too exciting. 
				You may be thinking to yourself: I thought the goal of this tutorial is to show 
				how to use an API to get data from your own website and access or display the returned results within your website. You would 
				be correct, so lets do that very thing. Let's now take what we now know from this page about how the New York Times API works 
				and lets actually use JavaScript in a web page to retrieve data from the API. Click on the button below to take the next step 
				in the tutorial and learn how to make a request to the New York Times API using JavaScript.
