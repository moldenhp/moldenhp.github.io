				By this point of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of what an API is, some of the features  of 
				the New York Times API and how to make a request using the New York Times API. Now we will look at how you can access 
				the data that was returned from the API request and then display this data on the screen. A real-world application for 
				this would be if you wanted to build a "newspaper website". You could have the user enter in the desired search critera 
				in your website and then you could display the search results formmated in such a manner in which your web page would 
				appear as an actual newspaper. Lets see how this can be done.<br><br>
				On the previous page there was a text box in which you could enter text and then submit the text via the Search button. 
				This request did indeed work and the data that was returned was stored in an object named "response". This object
				was not displayed on the screen but it did get logged to the console. To view this object in the console you can follow these 
				next few steps. It should be noted that you will need to be on the previous page (Making a Request) and that you should have 
				already entered in a word (such as "computer") in the text box and clicked on Search.<br><br>
				First, right-click anywhere on the web-page and select "Inspect". See the image below...<br><br>
				<center><img src="inspect.png" class="border"></center><br>
				Next, you want to want to click on "Console" at the top of the new side-window that opened up after you clicked on Inspect. See 
				the image below...<br><br>
				<center><img src="console.png" class="border"></center><br>
				Finally, click on object to expand different sub-categories that you can click on. See image below...<br><br>
				<center><img src="object.png" class="border"></center><br>
				You may have already guessed that the "object" that you just clicked on is the object that contains all of the returned JSON 
				data from the New York Times. Once you click on Object to expand it, a few more sub-categories appear. One of these categories 
				is labeled "repsonse". If you then click on "response" it will expand into more options (one of which is the "docs" option). 
				If you click on the "docs" category you will see that this is made up of an array of 10 different objects of its own. See image 
				below...<br><br>
				<center><img src="array.png" class="border"></center><br>
				You might have already figured out that each of these 10 different objects under "docs" are 10 different articles returned 
				from the New York Times. Each of these returned articles contain the search word(s) that you initially entered in the text 
				box from the web page. If you expand this "tree" of data even further by clicking on one of the objects, such as object 0, 
				you will see a whole bunch of information that is associated with this specific article. There are various sub-categories 
				such as headline, snippit, word count and web-url.<br><br>
				Now that you know how to view the different sections of the response that was logged to the console by clicking and expanding 
				the categories, lets access the same data but with JavaScript through your web page. When we access the data lets also use 
				JavaScript to display parts of the data to the screen. Look at the code segment below to see how this is done. There is just a 
				little bit more code added from the examples on the previous page. We will go over all of the new additions so that everything 
				makes sense.
			</p><br>
			<pre>
	document.getElementById("Search").addEventListener('click', function (event){
	var req= new XMLHttpRequest();
	var searchWord = document.getElementById("textBox").value;
	req.open("GET","https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q="+ searchWord +"&api-key="+apikey, true);
	req.addEventListener("load", function(){
		if(req.status >=200 && req.status < 400){
			var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
			console.log(response);
			
			function gotData(response){
				var articles = response.response.docs;
				
				for (var i = 0; i < articles.length; i++){
					console.log(articles[i].headline.main);
					var theHeadline = document.createElement("h1"); 
					var headlineText = document.createTextNode(articles[i].headline.main);
					theHeadline.appendChild(headlineText);
					document.body.appendChild(theHeadline);
					
					var articleData = document.createElement("p"); // create p element
					var snippitText = document.createTextNode(articles[i].snippet);
					articleData.appendChild(snippitText);
					document.body.appendChild(articleData);
				} 
			}
			
			gotData(response);  
		}
		else
			console.log("Error in network request: " + request.statusText);
		})
					
	req.send(null);
	event.preventDefault();
	})		
			</pre><br>
			
			<p>
				We now have our complete request to the New York Times API to get, access and display data based 
				on whatever the user enters in a text box. This code segment starts by creating an event handler for the "Search" button 
				that basically says: "When you click the 'Search' button, go and do this particular action". The action that we are refering to 
				is actually made up of a few smaller actions (discussed on the previous page). Before we get to the new additions, just as a 
				review we are creating a new XMLHttpRequest and then opening that request as a "GET" request to the specific content that is 
				desired. As soon as the request loads, then create an object which contains all of the returned data and then log this object 
				to the console.<br><br>
				Now for the new additions to the code. Right after logging the "returned data object" to the console, another function is 
				created that now accesses the data and displays it to the screen. Similar to how you "inspected" the previous web page, clicked on 
				"console" and traversed the returned object by expanding various sub-categories, in this function we are basically doing the 
				same thing through JavaScript. However instead of clicking on response and then on docs and then on object 0 to get to the 
				first article, we are now using the JavaScript code: response.docs.object[0]. Lets look at a smaller piece of this entire code 
				segment to now understand how to display the data on the screen after you access it...
			</p><br>
			
			<pre>
	for (var i = 0; i < articles.length; i++){
		console.log(articles[i].headline.main);
		var theHeadline = document.createElement("h1"); 
		var headlineText = document.createTextNode(articles[i].headline.main);
		theHeadline.appendChild(headlineText);
		document.body.appendChild(theHeadline);
					
		var articleData = document.createElement("p"); // create p element
		var snippitText = document.createTextNode(articles[i].snippet);
		articleData.appendChild(snippitText);
		document.body.appendChild(articleData);
	}		
			</pre><br>
			
			<p>
				Bsically, what is happening here is that we are looping through the array of the article data that was returned from the 
				request. For each article that we loop through, we are accessing the headline of that specific article, we create a new 
				element in the body of our web page to hold that headline and then we add this elment to the body of our web page so that 
				can be displayed on the screen. Right after the headline, a snippit of the returned article text is also added to the body 
				of our web page in the same manner. This is where a basic understanding of the DOM comes in handy. In this example we are 
				simply displaying the headline and snippit properties of each individual article. Any of the other data such as publication 
				date or word count could be accessed and displayed on the screen in this same manner. Just remember, the articles that get 
				returned from the New York Times comes back as an array of data. Each element of the array is one article and each article 
				has its own unique properties to it. You can access however many articles as you want and whatever categories of each article 
				that you want as well. Try it out below! Once you click on "Search" then the headlines and text snippits of the articles from 
				your search criteria will be displayed at the bottom of this web page.
